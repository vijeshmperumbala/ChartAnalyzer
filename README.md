  API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  
  // Model configuration
  MODEL: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  TEMPERATURE: 0.1,  // Lower for more deterministic responses
  MAX_TOKENS: 8192,  // Maximum response length
  
  // Analysis settings
  ANALYSIS_PROMPT: `

};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No analysis data available"**
   - Ensure your API key is correctly set in `config.js`
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify that the chart is visible in the captured area

2. **Copy button not working**
   - Make sure you're using a modern browser with clipboard API support
   - Check the browser console for any error messages (Ctrl+Shift+J)

3. **Slow response times**
   - The analysis depends on the Gemini API response time
   - Try reducing the `MAX_TOKENS` in the configuration if responses are too slow
